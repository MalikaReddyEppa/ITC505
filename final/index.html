   <p>The Light Toggle Game is a 5x5 grid-based puzzle where the goal is to turn on all the lights. At the start of each game, a random set of lights is turned on, with at least one active to ensure engagement. Players toggle lights logically by clicking tiles, with each action updating the light’s state visually. The interface includes “Play” and “Restart” buttons, and the grid is styled using CSS Grid for a clean layout. JavaScript handles the game logic and checks for a win condition, showing a success alert when all lights are on. The page also includes an addendum section and displays the last modified date in the footer.</p>
